# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Documenation

## Step 1
- we Include all the necessary libraries we will use from visual studio 2022

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <limits>
```

## Step 2
- We create 3 constant variables that will represent rock, paper and scissors. The reason i do this, is so that we dont have to worry about spelling issues later on and it can end up being a bit ambigous having writing them again

- One thing i learnt is that we cant use constexpr because std::string is not a literal type therefore the compiler wont know the value at compile time wich ruins the purpose of constexpr and it can even lead to some compilers failing to build because of this, so definatly something we will avoid by simply changing constexpr to a const string
```
const std::string rock = "Rock";
const std::string paper = "Paper";
const std::string scissors = "Scissors";
```

## Step 3
- Before starting this project i scanned through the project example wich was created here --> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/rock-paper-scissor-game-in-cpp/ and after scanning through the project example i came to a conclusion that we will need to create a function that will basically generate a random response that we will later compare to get the winner.

- I learnt a nice optimization technique that we can do to skip loads of if statements using an array to peform a lookup later on therefore removing the need to do an if statement for every possible outcome

- Ultimatly all this function does is generate a random number from 0 to 2 (0, 1, 2) and then peforming a quick index lookup through the objects array wich we return the value of to the function that is calling this function eg the main entry function
```
std::string generate_computers_move()
{
	const std::string objects[] = { rock, paper, scissors };

	int randomNum = (rand() % 3);
	return objects[randomNum];
}
```

## Step 4
- This is the function that will compare both results eg (players move and computers move) then after returning a character that will represent a loss, win or a draw. Note loads of if statement are peformed here to return all the possible outcomes although it can be a bit rebundant it gets the job done when you dont have loads of outcomes as a simple rock-paper-scissors game

- It should be pretty self-explanatory but (L = Loss, W = Won, D = Draw)
```
char generateWinner(const std::string& playerMove, const std::string& computerMove)
{
	if (playerMove == rock && computerMove == paper)
	{
		return 'L';
	}
	else if (playerMove == rock && computerMove == rock)
	{
		return 'D';
	}
	else if (playerMove == rock && computerMove == scissors)
	{
		return 'W';
	}
	else if (playerMove == paper && computerMove == paper)
	{
		return 'D';
	}
	else if (playerMove == paper && computerMove == rock)
	{
		return 'W';
	}
	else if (playerMove == paper && computerMove == scissors)
	{
		return 'L';
	}
	else if (playerMove == scissors && computerMove == paper)
	{
		return 'W';
	}
	else if (playerMove == scissors && computerMove == rock)
	{
		return 'L';
	}
	else if (playerMove == scissors && computerMove == scissors)
	{
		return 'D';
	}

	return '?';
}
```

```
// Creating the entry point of our program //
int main()
{
	// Initializing Timer For Random Number Generator //
	srand(time(nullptr));

	// Player Move Tracker //
	std::string playerMove;

	// Prompting User With Game Objects Selection //
	std::cout << "Welcome to rock / paper / scissors game.\tPress Enter to begin";
	std::cin.get();

	// Grabbing User Input //
	while (true) {
		std::cout << "Pick your game object: Rock | Paper | Scissors" << '\n';
		std::cin >> playerMove;
		if (playerMove == rock || playerMove == paper || playerMove == scissors)
			break;
		else
			std::cout << "Invalid Input: Please try again" << '\n';
	}

	// Generating Computers Move //
	std::string computerMove = generate_computers_move();

	// Comparing End Results //
	char gameResults = generateWinner(playerMove, computerMove);
	if (gameResults == '?')
	{
		std::cout << "Game failed to calculate winner, please try again";
		return 0;
	}

	// Prompting user with the end results on who won the game then exiting program //
	if (gameResults == 'W')
	{
		std::cout << "\n\t\t\tCongratulation you won the game";
	}
	else if (gameResults == 'L')
	{
		std::cout << "\n\t\t\tComputer won the game, Better luck next time :/";
	}
	else if (gameResults == 'D')
	{
		std::cout << "\n\t\t\tGame Draw, Better luck next time";
	}

	// Optional return before program automatically exits as the end of the main entry //
	return 0;
}
```
