# CGPA Calculator Documentation

## What is a CGPA calculator?
Before starting this project i admit it was very confusing at first to understand what GPA even meant as i dont live near usa or other countries that use the GPA grading for school systems, however after reading some articles like this one --> https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/what-gpa and watching this example --> https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&hs=cIq9&sca_esv=1af006d14f18ca7f&udm=7&sxsrf=ANbL-n4sxMSl454jkv00NZenz2XFGt6fYg:1768578416021&q=cgpa+calculator+c%2B%2B&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg-vmBtJCSAxWwWUEAHQ5hLpgQ8ccDKAJ6BAgZEAQ&biw=1869&bih=955&aic=0#fpstate=ive&ip=1&vld=cid:d352d401,vid:uCvnDAHfdeA,st:0 you should get a general understanding of what is required.

Overall our goal is to get how many courses the user has took then get the grade and the credit hours for those exams (Note. credit hours is part of the grading system and will effect the total gpa) then we optionally get the courses name to make it realistic (eg maths, english, computer science etc) then we apply this math formula below that will get the total gpa for the user.

```
//  grade * credit hours //
// --------------------- //
//     credit hours      //
```

## Step 1: Including Libraries
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <limits>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
```

## Step 2
This function will reset the input/output stream by clearing the leftover whitespaces and reseting the errors if any from std::cin
```
void discardLine() {
	if (std::cin.fail())
		std::cin.clear();

	std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
}
```
